1. please remove "main": "App.js", from package.json while building the app for production.
    because it will conflict with the entry point of the app.
2. npm start = npm run start = npx parcel index.html because we have defined start script in package.json

3. JSX is not HTML in javascript. it is a syntax extension to javascript. it is a javascript XML.
    It has HTML like syntax.

4. this JSX code is transpiled before it is executed by the browser.
    it is transpiled to javascript code by babel (parcel) and then executed by the browser.

5. Babel is a javascript compiler. it is used to transpile javascript code to older version of javascript.
    it is used to convert JSX to javascript.

6. attributes in JSX are camelCase. not kebab-case.

7. there are two types of react components.
    1. functional components- new way of creating react components. it uses javascripts arrow functions.
    2. class components- old way of creating react components. it uses javascript classes.

    fucntional components returns JSX code.

8. rendering component inside another component is called component composition.

9. JSX sanitization- it is a process of removing malicious code from JSX code. 
    It prevents cross site scripting attacks.

10. JSX can have only one root element. it cannot have multiple root elements.
    eg:- (
        <div>
            <h1>hello</h1>
            <h2>world</h2>
        </div>
    )
    
    not 
    (
        <h1>hello</h1>
        <h2>world</h2>
    )

    but if we want to have multiple root elements then we can use react fragments.
    eg:- (
        <React.Fragments>
            <h1>hello</h1>
            <h2>world</h2>
        </React.Fragments>
    )

    React fragments behaves like a wrapper. it does not render anything in the DOM.
    It is actually an empty tag.
    eg:-
    (
        <>
            <h1>hello</h1>
            <h2>world</h2>
        < />
    )
