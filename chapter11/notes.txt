1.Tailwind CSS
    1. CSS on the go (in same file)
    2. reusability
    3. less bundle size
    4. Flexible UI (Customization).

2.Props Drilling: Passing props from parent to child to child to child and so on.
    disadvantages:
    1. code becomes messy
    2. difficult to maintain
    3. difficult to debug
    4. rendering lots of components as changes in parent component will re-render all the child components.

3. We can pass props from parent to child but passing data from child to parent is possible by-
    1. local storage (not recommended)
    2. custom hooks (not recommended)
    2. redux
    3. context API

4. we have made accordion of show and hide button to display and undisplay a description in instamart.js

5. We cannot directly modify the state of other sibling components. 
   Inorder to do that we have to lift the state up to the parent component and 
   then pass it down to the child components as props. 
This is called LIFTING THE STATE UP.

6. usecontext hook is used to pass data from parent to child and child to child and so on.
  It is used to avoid props drilling.

  we can have multiple context in my app.

7. state and props are tied to a component. 
   If a component is unmounted then the state and props of that component will be destroyed.
   but context is not tied to a component.

8. context is like useState for whole app.

9. we can override the defaul value of context by passing value in provider.
    we have done this in app.js file. using userContext.provider
