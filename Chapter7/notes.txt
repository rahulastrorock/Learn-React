1. Use effect is called everytime the component is rendered if it has no dependency array.
2. Use effect is called only when the component is mounted if it has an empty dependency array.
3. use effect is called everytime the dependency array changes.

    when applayout is rendered, it will render the outlet component and the outlet component will render the children routes.

8.dont use the anchor tag to navigate between pages in react. use the link component from react router dom.
    because anchor tag will refresh the page and react will lose its state.

9. using link to doesnot refreshes the whole page. it just renders the component that is to be rendered.
    that is why react is called a single page application.

10. server side routing - when we navigate between pages, the whole page is refreshed.
    *imp- when we navigate between pages, the whole page is not refreshed. only the component that is to be rendered is rendered.

    thus we are implementing client side routing using react router dom.

11. dynamic route- when we want to pass some data to the route, we use dynamic route.
